/**
 * To wrap a token deployed on Polygon Mumbai, 
 * you would typically use a wrapping service or 
 * protocol that supports the Polygon network. 
 * One popular option for wrapping tokens on 
 * Polygon is the Polygon PoS Bridge. 
 * 
 * 
 Below is an example of how you can use the Polygon PoS Bridge to wrap a token deployed on Polygon Mumbai:
 */
// Define the Polygon Mumbai RPC endpoint
const polygonMumbaiRpcUrl = 'https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com';

// Create an Ethereum provider using the Polygon Mumbai RPC endpoint
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(polygonMumbaiRpcUrl);

// Initialize your wallet with a private key or mnemonic
const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY';
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

// Define the address of the token you want to wrap
const tokenAddress = 'TOKEN_ADDRESS';

// Define the amount of tokens you want to wrap
const amountToWrap = ethers.utils.parseEther('AMOUNT_IN_ETHER');

// Define the address of the Polygon PoS Bridge contract
const bridgeAddress = '0x40ec5B33f54e0E8A33A975908C5BA1c14e5BbbDf';

// Connect to the Polygon PoS Bridge contract using its ABI
const bridgeABI = ['ABI_OF_POLYGON_POS_BRIDGE_CONTRACT'];
const bridgeContract = new ethers.Contract(bridgeAddress, bridgeABI, wallet);

// Approve the Bridge contract to spend the tokens
const approveTx = await tokenContract.approve(bridgeAddress, amountToWrap);
await approveTx.wait();

// Wrap the tokens using the Polygon PoS Bridge
const wrapTx = await bridgeContract.depositERC20(tokenAddress, amountToWrap);
await wrapTx.wait();

console.log('Tokens wrapped successfully.');



/*Make sure to replace 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY', 'TOKEN_ADDRESS', 'AMOUNT_IN_ETHER', and 'ABI_OF_POLYGON_POS_BRIDGE_CONTRACT' with your actual private key, the address of the token you want to wrap, the amount of tokens you want to wrap, and the ABI of the Polygon PoS Bridge contract, respectively.

Please note that you need to have enough balance of the token in your wallet to cover the wrapping process, and you may also need to approve the Bridge contract to spend your tokens before wrapping them. Additionally, ensure that you are using the correct contract addresses and ABIs for the Polygon PoS Bridge and the token you want to wrap.
